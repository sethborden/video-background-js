## VideoBackground.js

Very simple jquer plugin to add an html5 video as background to an element on a
page with a few limited options. If you're looking for a quick way to add a
video background to a full webpage, include the following snippet in your
`$(document).ready()` function:

```javascript
$('body').videoBackground('<path to your video file>');
```
